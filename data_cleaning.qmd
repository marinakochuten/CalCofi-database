# Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
```

```{r}
# Read in data
bottle <- read_csv(here("data", "Bottle.csv"), locale = locale(encoding = "latin1"))
cast <- read_csv(here("data", "Cast.csv"))
```

# Notes

Cast count (Cst_Cnt) is the primary key in cast data
Bottle count (Btl_Cnt) is the primary key in bottle data

Metadata instructs to join tables on Cst_Cnt

# Clean cast data

```{r}
glimpse(cast)

# Let's get the date column into date type
cast_clean <- cast |>
  
```
